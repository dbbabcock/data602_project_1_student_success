(Note: This is simulated data for practicing with)

<h1>Data Features:</h1>

This dataset is contains generated data for 10,000 students, several features about them, and their performance on 3 tests (Math, Reading, and Writing). The features are:

1. Sex
2. Ethnic Group (Anonymized)
3. 

The features are relatively limited, and other information about conditions the clients suffer from (heart disease, diabetes, etc.), repeat visits, medications, etc. would be useful but are not presently available. For now, the company hopes to demonstrate that this data could prove useful to the future of the company and that analyzing it is a worthwhile endeavor.
