    "This project uses generated data about students and their test scores on three tests. Since the results are a continuous variable (average test score), the initial analysis was performed by regression. In order to make the project more interesting, I am creating a scenario where this data is related to a fictional experiment by UMBC:\n",

    "UMBC has begun administering entrance exams in Math, Reading, and Writing in order to ensure students are prepared for the rigors of academic study. After the first 5,000 tests were completed, the administration wanted to see what features about the students, if any, could be used to predict their average score on the tests. The features extracted were Sex, Ethnic Group, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Status (Standard or Reduced / Free), and Test Preparation (Completed or Not).\n",
    "<br>   \n",
    "A data science student was asked to try to build a model that could predict the average score a student would achieve on the tests using the features provided above. Two models were ultimately used, an OLS regression and a Decision Tree.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Unfortunately, neither model was terribly good at predicting the average score based on the provided features. Given the low R^2 value generated by both models, it seems that the features are overall not very good predictors for this purpose."
